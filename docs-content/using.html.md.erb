This topic describes how to use Stardog PCF

##<a id='using'></a> Using Stardog PCF

The Stardog tile will deploy a service broker into the PCF environment.
This service broker is then used to connection PCF apps to Stardog
Knowledge Graphs.

### Create An Instance

In order to create an instance of a Stardog PCF service the following
information is needed:

 1. The URL to a pre-provisioned Stardog service.
 1. The admin username and password for the Stardog service.
 1. A configuration file with the above information.

For information on how to run Stardog please see the
[documentation](https://docs.stardog.com/). An example configuration
file for creating a service is shown below:
 <pre class="json">
  {
    "url": "http://pcftile-1058783714.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:5820",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "somepassword"
  }</pre>

Once this file is in place create a service with the following command:
 <pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service Stardog perinstance myservice -c ~/service.json
Creating service instance myservice in org stardog-service-broker-org / space stardog-service-broker-space as admin...
OK
 </pre>

The Stardog PCF service broker instructed Stardog to create a new
knowledge graph and associated it with the newly created PCF service
instance.  It is now ready to be bound to PCF applications.

### Bind An Application To A Service

The **perinstance** plan does not require any additional configuration.
There are a couple of ways to bind a PCF application to a service
instance.  It can either be bound using the **cf bind-service** command or
by adding a **services** stanza to the applications **manifest.yml** file.
More information on this process can be found
[here](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-identity/1-1/bind-apps.html).

When a Stardog PCF service instance is bound to a PCF application a new
Stardog user is created and associated with that PCF application.

### VCAP_SERVICES

Once an application is bound to a service instance the needed
connection information and credetials will be available to the PCF app in the
VCAP_SERVICES environment variable.  The Stardog entry has the following
fields:

| Field             | Type      | Description
| -----             | ----      | ------------ |
| url               | string    | The URL of the Stardog service that is bound to the application. |
| db_name           | string    | The Stardog database name to which the application is bound . |
| username          | string    | The username credential that the application can use to connect to the Stardog database. |
| password          | string    | The password credential that the application can use to connect to the Stardog database. |

An example VCAP_SERVICES document is below:

 <pre class="terminal">
{"Stardog":
   [
     {"name": "stardog-service",
      "label": "Stardog",
      "tags": [],
      "plan": "shareddb",
      "credentials": {
          "db_name": "dbABzeMjTwwwvyuoiO",
          "url": "http://somehost.com:5821",
          "password": "QQttqbmLVkzvfaWVKlUrthnT",
          "username": "stardogHOPvOMwo"
      }
     }
   ]
}
 </pre>
